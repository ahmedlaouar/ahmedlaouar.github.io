       The inconsistency management line of work was also a main interest of my PhD thesis, where I had to deal with both theoritical and practical challenges of developing a new efficient method for inconsistency management in lightweight ontologies. In addition, I also had the opportunity to investigate access control security policies and their backbone models. Mainly, via the study of methdos to generate useful and human-friendly natural language explanations for the decisions of such systems. I am also an active member of the european project [STARWARS](https://sites.google.com/view/horizoneurope2020-starwars/home), which allowed me to visit three different universities, integrate research teams, and collaborate on issues of ontology engineering, explanation of reasoning in the presence of inconsistency, and natural language generation using large language models.
        My PhD, and also my current work in academia, gave me the opportunity to join teaching teams and participate in teaching activities. Teaching is, for me, an integral part of the life of a researcher. As it is the way of communicating and sharing knowledge. During this years, I was mainly in contact with first and second year university students, where I had to work with them both on tutorials and practical work on fundemental topics, such as basics of algorithms and programming, functional programming and web development.
