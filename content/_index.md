      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
       Currently in the third year of my PhD at CRIL, my research focuses on the management of contradictory information in lightweight ontologies, as well as on explainable AI, with a specific application context in access control systems. The aim is to develop efficient methods for dealing with possible inconsistencies, while providing clear and useful explanations of the decisions made. Iâ€™m also part of the European project \href{https://sites.google.com/view/horizoneurope2020-starwars/}{STARWARS}, which focuses on data management for wastewater networks. Iâ€™m working mainly on issues related to inconsistent data and explainability of the proposed solutions.
