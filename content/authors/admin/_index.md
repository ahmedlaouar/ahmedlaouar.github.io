    summary: |
      This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
      - Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
      - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
      - Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
      The course draws from numerous case studies and applications, in order to apply learning algorithms to build smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.

## About Me

Holder of a PhD in computer science from the University of Artois, I am now occupying the position of a postdoctoral research engineer among the [RATIO](https://ratio.labri.fr/) team at the CNRS UMR 5800: [LaBRI](https://www.labri.fr/). My research interests involve dealing with inconsistent and contradictory information, from ontologies to databases, the development of efficient methods to query and manage prioritized and inconsistent large scale databases, in addition to the explanation of reasoning in the presence of inconsistency. My main tasks at the RATIO team include implementating, developping efficient algorithms and experimenting with inconsistency-tolerant query answering methods.
