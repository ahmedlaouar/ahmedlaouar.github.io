    summary: |
      This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: 
      - Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
      - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
      - Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
      The course draws from numerous case studies and applications, in order to apply learning algorithms to build smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
