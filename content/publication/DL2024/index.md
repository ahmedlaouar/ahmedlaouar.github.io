abstract: We deal with repairing inconsistent partially ordered lightweight ontologies in the possibilistic setting. More specifically, we consider the closure-based Cùúã-repair method, which yields a more productive partially ordered possibilistic repair and is tractable in DL-Lite‚Ñõ. In this work, we refine the characterization of the Cùúã-repair method and propose an equivalent algorithm that is more efficient. We illustrate our findings with an experimental analysis. In particular, we highlight the main situations in which the Cùúã-repair method achieves the best performance both in terms of productivity and computational cost.
